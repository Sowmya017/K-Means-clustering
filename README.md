# K-Means Clustering Mini Project
## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group similar data points. It includes visualization, cluster evaluation, and selection of the optimal number of clusters.

## Steps Followed

Load and visualize the dataset – Used PCA for 2D visualization.

Fit K-Means – Assigned cluster labels to data points.

Elbow Method – Determined the optimal number of clusters (K).

Visualize Clusters – Displayed color-coded clusters in 2D space.

Evaluate with Silhouette Score – Measured clustering quality with if-based interpretation.

Key Libraries

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

sklearn (datasets, KMeans, PCA, silhouette_score)

## Output

Elbow plot for optimal K

2D scatter plot of clusters

Silhouette Score with qualitative interpretation
